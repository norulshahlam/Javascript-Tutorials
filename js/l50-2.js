/*this is how you use to export with / without default keyword. for exporting without 'default' keyword, u must use the export keyword during creation of variables. with 'default', u must only export AFTER creation. else it gives error.

Technically, we may have both default and named exports in a single module, but in practice people usually donâ€™t mix them. A module has either named exports or the default one.
