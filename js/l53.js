/* 
Symbol is a primitive data type of JavaScript, along with string, number, boolean, null and undefined.

It was introduced in ECMAScript 2015, so just a few years ago.

Itâ€™s a very peculiar data type. Once you create a symbol, its value is kept private and for internal use.

All that remains after the creation is the symbol reference.

symbols are ignored in json.stringify

const KEY1 = Symbol();
const KEY2 = Symbol();

const myObj = {};

myObj[KEY1] = 'prop1';
myObj[KEY2] = 'prop2';
myObj.key3 = 'prop3';
myObj.key4 = 'prop4';

// console.log(myObj[KEY1]);
// console.log(myObj[KEY2]);

//symbols are not enumarable in 'for in' loop
for (let i in myObj) {
  console.log(`${ i }: ${ myObj[i] }`);
