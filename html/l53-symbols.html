    <p>
      Symbol is a primitive data type of JavaScript, along with string, number, boolean, null and undefined.

    </p>
    <p>

      It was introduced in ECMAScript 2015.

    </p>
    <p>

      Itâ€™s a very peculiar data type. Once you create a symbol, its value is kept private and for internal use.

    </p>
    <p>
      All that remains after the creation is the symbol reference.

    </p>
    <p> symbols are ignored in json.stringify
